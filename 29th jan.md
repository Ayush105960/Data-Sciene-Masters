 1.  Who dove loped python Prog rammin Language? 

Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum


```python

```

2. Which type of programming does python support?

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, functional, and aspect-oriented programming.


```python

```

3.Is python case sensitive when 	i ing with idem Eifiers?

Yes, Python is case-sensitive when working with identifier name


```python

```

4. What is the correct extension of the python 

.py


```python

```

5. Is python coda compiiad or interpreted?

Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. This means that the code is executed line by line at runtime, instead of being compiled into machine code before execution.


```python

```

6. Name a few bleus of code used to define in python language?

In Python, the blocks of code are defined using indentation. The following blocks of code can be defined in Python:

* Functions: defined using the "def" keyword
* Classes: defined using the "class" keyword
* Loops: for loops and while loops
* Conditional statements: if, elif, and else statements
* Context managers: defined using the "with" statement.


```python

```

7.  State a character usedto give single—line commones inpythonP

In Python, the "#" symbol is used to create single-line comments


```python

```

8. Mention functions which can help us ea find the version of python that wo aro currently working on?

In Python, the following functions can be used to find the version of Python that you are currently working on:

* sys.version
* sys.version_info
* platform.python_version()





```python

```

9. 9.	python supports the emotion of anonymous functions at runtime using a constr uet eaiiød
 


In Python, anonymous functions at runtime can be created using the lambda keyword, which creates what is commonly referred to as a "lambda function
* Syntax :
lambda arguments: expression



```python
exponential_value = lambda x, y: x**y
print(exponential_value(3, 4))  # Output: 7

```

10. 10.	What does pip s tand for python?

"pip" stands for "Pip Installs Packages"


```python

```

11. Me ntion a low built—in functions in pyth on?

Here are a few built-in functions in Python:

*print(): used for outputting data to the console
* len(): returns the length of an object
*int(): converts a value to an integer
* float(): converts a value to a floating-point number
* str(): converts a value to a string
* list(): creates a list from an iterable
* tuple(): creates a tuple from an iterable
* set(): creates a set from an iterable
* dict(): creates a dictionary from an iterable
* range(): generates a sequence of numbers
* min(): returns the minimum value from an iterable
* max(): returns the maximum value from an iterable
* sum(): returns the sum of values in an iterable
* sorted(): returns a sorted list from an iterable
* abs(): returns the absolute value of a number.


```python

```

12. 12.	What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?

In Python, there is no specific limit on the length of an identifier (variable name, function name, class name, etc.). However, the maximum length of an identifier is limited by the underlying system's memory limitations and the maximum length of a string object in Python, which is determined by the constant sys.maxsize. 

import sys
sys.maxsize


```python

```

13.	What are the benefits of using Python?

Here are some of the benefits of using Python:

* Easy to Learn
* Versatile
* Large Community
* Plenty of Libraries and Frameworks
* Interoperable: Python can be easily integrated with other programming languages and tools, making it a good choice for working with existing systems.
* Cross-Platform


```python

```

14. 14.	How is memory managed in Python?

In Python, memory management is handled automatically by the Python memory manager. The memory manager is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory as needed by the Python interpreter and the programs running on it.

The memory manager uses a system called reference counting to keep track of how many references to an object exist in the program. When the number of references to an object goes to zero, the memory manager frees the memory occupied by that object.

Additionally, Python also uses a system called garbage collection to automatically collect and free memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program. The garbage collector periodically runs in the background and frees memory occupied by objects that are no longer accessible from any part of the program.

This makes memory management in Python relatively easy and hassle-free, compared to languages like C and C++ where memory management must be performed manually by the programmer.


```python

```

15. How to install Python on Windows and set pa th variables?

Here's a step-by-step guide to installing Python on Windows and setting the path variables:

Download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Run the Python installation package by double-clicking on the downloaded file.

Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. Make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.

Once the installation is complete, open the Command Prompt (Win + X -> Command Prompt) and run the following command to check the installed version of Python:

css
Copy code
python --version
To set the path variables in Windows, follow these steps:

Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables".
Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
Under "System Variables", scroll down and find the "Path" variable.
Click on "Edit" and add the location of the Python executable (e.g., C:\PythonXX\python.exe, where XX is the version number).
Click "OK" to save the changes.
Close and reopen the Command Prompt, then run the following command to verify that Python is accessible from the command line:

Copy code
python
This should open the Python interpreter, and you should be able to start using Python on your Windows system.


```python

```

16. . Is indentation required in python?

yes .
